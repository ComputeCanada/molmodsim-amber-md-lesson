## Running simulations with AMBER
### 1.1 Energy minimization.
Before simulating a system we need to relax it. Any atomic clashes must be resolved, and potential energy minimized to avoid unphysically large forces that can crash a simulation. 

Let's check our model for clashes.

As the RNA model was built without protein, it is expected that the added RNA residues may be placed too close to some aminoacid residues. You can inspect severe clashes between the protein and the RNA residues visually to ensure that there are no severe problems that can not be fixed automatically (such as overlapping ring structures). 

There is nothing too serious that may crash simulation, the clashes will be resolved in the process of energy minimization.  As we want to keep our initial simulation structure as close to the experimental structure as possible we first allow energy minimizer to move freely only new added residues, and restrain all original residues. So we need a list of all original atoms to restrain them. 

In the simulation system residues are renumbered. Chain identifiers are not used. There is a single list of all atoms where atoms and residues are numbered sequentially starting form 1 without any gaps. To make a list of restrained atoms we need to convert PDB residue numbers to simulation residue numbers. Residue number mapping between the original PDB file and the simulation is as follows:

Chain       | Original | Shift | Simulation |
------------|----------|-------|------------|
Protein   A | 1-859    |  -    | 1-859      |
RNA chain C | 1-21     | 859   | 860-880    |
RNA chain D | 1-18     | 898   | 881-898    |
MG ions     |    -     |  -    | 899-901    |

>2. Modify the AMBERMASK that you created to narrow selection to only backbone atoms.

The general minimization strategy is first to restrict all solute atoms with the experimental coordinates and relax all atoms that were added. (solvent, ions and missing fragments). This will help to stabilize the native conformation. There are no strict rules defining how many minimization steps are necessary. The choice will depend on the composition of a simulation system. For a big systems with a large amount of missing residues it is safer to carry out several minimization steps gradually releasing restraints. For example, you can first relax only solvent and ions, then lipid bilayer (if this is a membrane protein), then added fragments, then the original protein side-chains. Having more steps may be unnecessary, but it will not cause any problems. 

Let's do a two a two stage minimization. In the first stage we restrain all original atoms. In the second stage we restrain only the original backbone atoms.

Simulation programs can do a lot of different things, and every type of calculation has a number of parameters that allow us to control what will be done. To run a minimization we need to make an input file describing exactly what we want to do and how we want to do it:

- instruct a simulation program to minimize energy  
- choose a method of minimization  
- specify the maximum number of cycles of minimization  
- apply restraints to a subset of atoms (optionally)

A simulation program reads simulation parameters from an input file. Simulation parameters in AMBER are called "FLAGS". The Table below lists some important minimization FLAGS.   

#### AMBER minimization parameters

| Flag        | Value     | Description
|-------------|-----------|-----------
|imin         |     1     | Turn on minimization
|ntmin        | 0,1,2,3   | Flag for the method of minimization    
|maxcyc       | integer   | The maximum number of cycles of minimization  
|ncyc         | integer   | If NTMIN=1 switch from SD to CG after NCYC cycles  
|ntpr         | integer n | Print energies every n steps    
|ntr          |    1      | Use cartesian harmonic restraints   
|restraint_wt | float     | Restraint force kcal/mol   
|restraintmask| ambermask | Specifies restrained atoms   

#### Methods of minimization

|--|
|0 |Steepest descent+conjugate gradient. The first 4 cycles are steepest descent at the start of the run and after every non-bonded pair-list update.
|1 | For NCYC cycles the steepest descent method is used then conjugate gradient is switched on.
|2 | Steepest descent only
|3 | XMIN family methods. The default is LBFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno). It is a popular algorithm in machine learning. The method incrementally learns from previous steps, so that it can make the next step more accurate. It converges considerably faster than CG, but requires more memory.

The option -O means: overwrite the output files if present.  
The output from the minimization goes into the file *mdout*. The total energy of the system is printed in the lines beginning with "EAMBER =". If minimization is successful we expect to see large negative energies.

>## Why minimization fails?
>When you run minimization with the input file *min1.in* as described above the program crashes after 4 cycles. Try to understand why minimization is unstable, and how to fix the problem. 
>>## Solution
>>With ntmin=0  the minimization method is switched from SD to CG only 4 SD cycles. As initial system has very high energy, 4 SD cycles are not sufficient to relax it well enough for CG to work.   
Try to increase the number of CG cycles to 30 (ntmin=1, ncyc=30).   
Examine mdout. How many SD steps are needed for total energy to become negative?     
Try using an alternative minimization method (SD only or LBFGS). What method converges faster?

## 2. Running simulations with NAMD
### 2.1 Energy minimization
There are only two minimization methods in NAMD, conjugate gradient and simple velocity quenching. All input and output related parameters are configured in input files. NAMD takes only one command line argument, the name of the input file.

NAMD reads constraints from a specially prepared pdb file describing constraint force for each atom in a system. Constraint forces can be given in x,y,z, occupancy or beta columns.

## 3. Transferring equilibrated system between simulation packages.
Simulation packages have different methods and performance. It is useful to be able to transfer a running simulation from one software to another. Imagine that you started your project with GROMACS, but later realized that you need to run a constant pH simulation. You need to switch to AMBER. Want to study conformational transitions? Gaussian accelerated MD is not available in GROMACS. Another reason to move to AMBER/NAMD. 
Want to apply custom forces - move to NAMD.


#### 3.1. Moving simulation from NAMD to AMBER.
NAMD saves coordinates, velocity and periodic box in separate files. In AMBER all information required to restart simulation is in one text (.rst7) or netcdf (.ncrst) file. To prepare AMBER restart file we first convert namd binary files to amber text restart files with VMD:

~~~
cd ~/scratch/Ago-RNA_sim/sim_pmemd/2-production
cp ~/scratch/Ago-RNA_sim/sim_namd/5-equilibration-unconstrained/{equilibration.coor,equilibration.vel,equilibration.xsc} .
module load intel vmd
vmd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# Convert velocities
mol new equilibration.vel type namdbin
set sel [atomselect top all]
$sel writerst7 vel.rst7
# Convert coordinates
mol new equilibration.coor
set sel [atomselect top "all"]
$sel writerst7 coor.rst7
quit
~~~
{: .vmd}

Now we can read these files along with the extended system (.xsc) file and prepare the complete rst7 file. We will do it with ParmEd, the program for editing AMBER parameter and coordinate files.

NAMD controls pressure differently from AMBER, so when we transfer simulation to AMBER pressure will be too high. It will relax on its own, but we can slightly rescale coordinates and periodic box to speed up pressure equilibration.

We converted NAMD restart files to AMBER restart and we can continue simulation with AMBER. AMBER suite includes several simulation codes: sander, sander.MPI, pmemd, pmemd.MPI, pmemd.cuda. Sander is free version, pmemd is commercial. Sander and pmemd are serial (CPU only) programs; sander.MPI and pmemd.MPI are parallel (CPU only); and pmemd.cuda is GPU version.

Submitting pmemd.cuda on Siku:

~~~
{: .language-bash}

PMEMD is highly optimized to do all computations in one GPU, and it runs exceptionally fast. It CANNOT be used efficiently on more than one GPU because of the overhead from moving data between GPUs.

#### 3.2 Moving simulation from AMBER to GROMACS.
To transfer simulation to GROMACS in addition to converting restart file we need to convert topology.

~~~

Position restraints are defined within molecule blocks, they must be included within the correct `moleculetype` block after all atoms are defined (after the `atoms` block). The end of the `moleculetype` block  is a good place.

The atom numbers in position restraints `.itp` files must match the atom numbers in a corresponding `moleculetype` block. Our topology file `gromacs.top`  includes several molecules. The protein is the first, `system1` molecule. The nucleic acids are is the second `system2` and the third `system3` molecules.

WARNING: the genrestr program can generate the correct restraints file only for the first molecule. If you need to restrain the second molecule this tool will not work. To generate a valid constraint file you need to shift indexes in the posre.itp file by the number of atoms in the preceding molecule(s). This can be done by generating separate topology files for each of the RNA chains.

This is a long job, so for now we will restrain only protein. Let's prepare position restraint files for `system1`.

Add definitions of the position restraints to the topology "gromacs.top". Use a text editor of your choice to insert the following lines at the end of the system1 molecule block:
~~~
#ifdef ORIG_PROT_POSRES
#include "orig_prot.itp"
#endif
#ifdef ORIG_PROT_BACKBONE
#include "orig_prot_backbone.itp"
#endif
~~~
{: .text}

Now we can include any of these two files from the minimization input file by defining a corresponding variable

Then convert velocities and coordinates:

Amber operates in kcal/mol units for energy, amu for masses,
and Angstoms for distances. For convenience when calculating KE from
velocity, the velocities have a conversion factor built in; as a result the Amber unit of time is (1/20.455) ps.
So to convert Amber velocities from internal units to Ang/ps multiply by 20.455. The number itself is derived from sqrt(1 / ((AMU_TO_KG * NA) / (1000 * CAL_TO_J))).
